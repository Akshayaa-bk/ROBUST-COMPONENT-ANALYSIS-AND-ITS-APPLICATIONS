# ROBUST-COMPONENT-ANALYSIS-AND-ITS-APPLICATIONS

# Filling in missing or corrupted parts of an image
reconstruct a corrupted image by applying RobustPCA to 
overlapping patches. The low-rank component represents the filled-in 
regions, while the sparse component captures the corrupted or missing 
parts. The final recovered image combines the reconstructed regions with 
the original corrupted areas.



# Video surveillance 
given a sequence of surveillance video frames, we need to identify 
activities that stand out from the background. We stack the video frames as 
columns of a matrix M, then the low-rank component L0 naturally 
corresponds to the stationary background and the sparse component S0 
captures the moving objects in the foreground.
